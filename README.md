# Java Projects - README

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of simple Java Swing applications developed for educational purposes. Each application is designed to demonstrate a basic concept of GUI development in Java using the Swing library. Below is a list of the assignments included in this repository along with a brief description of each.

## Applications

### 1. Simple Login Form
This application creates a basic login form with fields for username and password. If the user enters "admin" as the username and "1234" as the password, a "Login successful" message is displayed; otherwise, a "Login failed" message is shown.

### 2. Basic Calculator
A basic calculator application that can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between two numbers. Users enter the numbers in text fields and click the corresponding operation button to see the result.

### 3. To-Do List Application
This is a simple to-do list application where users can add and remove tasks. Users can enter a new task in a text field and click an "Add Task" button. The tasks are displayed in a list, and users can remove selected tasks by clicking the "Remove Task" button.

### 4. Temperature Converter
An application that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit. Users can enter a temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit and convert it to the other unit using the respective button.

### 5. Student Grade Calculator
This application calculates the average grade of a student based on scores entered in three subjects. The application also assigns a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the calculated average.

### 6. Simple Stopwatch
A stopwatch application with start, stop, and reset buttons. The stopwatch displays the elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and centiseconds (hr:min:sec:00).

### 7. Currency Converter
This application converts an amount from USD to other currencies, including EUR, GBP, and INR, using live exchange rates. 

### 8. Personal Information Form
A personal information form where users enter details like their name, age, gender, and country. Upon submission, the entered information is displayed in a message box.

### 9. Voting Poll
A simple voting poll application where users can vote for their favorite programming language (Java, Python, C++). Votes are counted, and users are prevented from voting more than once.

### 10. Color Picker
A color picker application that allows users to select RGB values using sliders. The selected color is displayed in a panel, changing dynamically as the sliders are adjusted.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or above
- An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans to run and edit the code

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the appropriate directory and open the desired Java file in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the Java file.

## Purpose
These applications are meant to provide a foundation for learning Java Swing and building GUI-based applications. Each assignment is crafted to be beginner-friendly, focusing on core Java concepts such as event handling, component layout, and user interaction.
